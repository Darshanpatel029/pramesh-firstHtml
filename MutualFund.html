                                    returns on their capital over a period. This

                                                    ii) you can hire a full-time
                                                    driver

                                                </ul>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>In the first scenario, you would
                                                have to take driving lessons,
                                                pass the driving test and obtain
                                                a license. But if you don’t have
                                                the time for driving classes, it
                                                is better to opt for a driver.
                                                Same is the case with
                                                investments. Investing in
                                                financial markets requires a
                                                certain amount of skill. You
                                                need to research the market and
                                                analyse the best options
                                                available. You need knowledge on
                                                matters such as macro economy,
                                                sectors, company financials,
                                                from an asset class perspective.
                                                This requires a significant
                                                amount of time and commitment
                                                from you.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>But if you don’t have the skill
                                                or the time to delve deep into
                                                the market, investing in mutual
                                                funds can be an excellent
                                                alternative. Here, a
                                                professional fund manager takes
                                                care of your investments and
                                                strives hard to provide
                                                reasonable returns. And just as
                                                you would pay the driver for his
                                                chauffeuring services, you have
                                                to pay specific fees for the
                                                professional management of your
                                                mutual fund investments. Returns
                                            </p>
                                            <p>One of the biggest mutual fund
                                                benefits is that you have the
                                                opportunity to earn potentially
                                                higher returns than traditional
                                                investment options offering
                                                assured returns. This is because
                                                the returns on mutual funds are
                                                linked to the market’s
                                                performance. So, if the market
                                                is on a bull run and it does
                                                exceedingly well, the impact
                                                would be reflected in the value
                                                of your fund. However, a poor
                                                performance in the market could
                                                negatively impact your
                                                investments. Unlike traditional
                                                investments ,mutual funds do not
                                                assure capital protection. So do
                                                your research and invest in
                                                funds that can help you meet
                                                your financial goals at the
                                                right time in life.

                                            <p>You may have heard the saying:
                                                Don’t put all your eggs in one
                                                basket. This is a famous mantra
                                                to remember when you invest your
                                                money. When you invest only in a
                                                single asset, you could risk a
                                                loss if the market crashes.
                                                However, you can avoid this
                                                problem by investing in
                                                different asset classes and
                                                diversifying your portfolio. If
                                                you were investing in stocks and
                                                had to diversify, you would have
                                                to select at least ten stocks
                                                carefully from different
                                                sectors. This can be a lengthy,
                                                time-consuming process. But when
                                                you invest in mutual funds, you
                                                achieve diversification
                                                instantly. For instance, if you

                                                tracks the BSE Sensex, you would
                                                get access to as many as 30
                                                stocks across sectors in a
                                                single fund. This could reduce

                                            <p>Mutual fund investors can claim a
                                                tax deduction of up to Rs. 1.5
                                                lakh by investing in Equity
                                                Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS).
                                                This tax benefit is eligible
                                                under Section 80C of the Income
                                                Tax Act. ELSS funds come with a
                                                lock-in period of 3 years.
                                                Hence, if you invest in ELSS
                                                funds, you can only withdraw
                                                your money after the lock-in
                                                period ends. Another tax benefit
                                                is indexation benefit available
                                                on debt funds. In case of
                                                traditional products, all
                                                interest earned is subject to
                                                tax. However, in case of debt
                                                mutual funds, only the returns
                                                earned over and above the
                                                inflation rate (embedded in cost
                                                inflation index {CII}) are
                                                subject to tax. This could also
                                                help investors earn higher post
                                                tax returns.
